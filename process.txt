This file will detail the process to create program, i.e. it will include information on methods, ideas,
procedures and possible extensions and things to add.

-- ==========================================================================================
Will be using:
     Data.Vector.Unboxed as a general array for holding values.
     Will proably use binary data to hold values? Just for simplicity?
          Could be made simple by allowing the initial state of the matrix to be read from a file as 1's and 0's

     Nope, ended up using Algebraic data type Life with Alive | Dead.
     Created 2 dimesional (Vector Life) fro random values.
